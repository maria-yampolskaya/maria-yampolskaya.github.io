Hello! I am a graduate student in the [Physics Department](http://physics.bu.edu/) at Boston University. I've worked on research projects in a variety of fields, from disk packing on a torus to cyclotron simulations. I've recently settled into a (hopefully stable) energy minimum working on theoretical biophysics with [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/). The group studies statistical mechanics of disordered systems. Currently I'm interested in epigenetic landscapes, so I'm learning about spin glass systems and attractor neural networks.
