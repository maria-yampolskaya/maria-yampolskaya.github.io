I am a postdoctoral researcher in biophysics working with [Paul Francois](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/our-researchers/professors-directory/researcher/is/in35548/) at the University of Montreal. I'm broadly interested in how robust behavior emerges from biological systems, especially in embryonic development. See my Google Scholar for the most up-to-date preprints and papers.

I did my Ph.D. in physics with [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/) at Boston University. I worked on models of cell fate differentiation combining landscapes and Hopfield models. During my Ph.D., I also worked on creating quantitative tools that provide insight into how cells make fate decisions. I developed [scTOP](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.201873) ([Github repo](https://github.com/Emergent-Behaviors-in-Biology/scTOP/tree/main)), a Python package for tracking cell identity from single-cell RNA-sequencing data using Hopfield-inspired cell fate coordinates. Feel free to reach out if you'd like help applying it to your analysis!
