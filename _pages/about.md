I am a graduate student working in biophysics theory in [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/)'s group in the Boston University [Physics Department](http://physics.bu.edu/). I'm interested in statistical physics and how organization arises from complex systems.

From error correction in DNA replication to robustness in cellular differentiation, multicellular development is a source of fascinating physical phenomena. I'm interested in modelling cell types as attractor basins in an energy landscape. I have developed a [package for analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing](https://github.com/Emergent-Behaviors-in-Biology/scTOP) using a Hopfield-model-inspired algorithm from previous work by Pankaj's group. I'm applying this algorithm to samples created by our collaborators with stem cell differentiation protocols. I'm also interested in studying bifurcations in the Hopfield model to better understand cell fate decisions.
