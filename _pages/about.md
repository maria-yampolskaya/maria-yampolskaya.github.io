I am a Ph.D. candidate working on theoretical biophysics in [Pankaj Mehta](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/)'s group in the Boston University [Physics Department](http://physics.bu.edu/). I'm broadly interested in how robust behavior emerges from complex systems, especially in biological contexts. During my Ph.D., I've worked on creating quantitative tools that provide insight into how cells
make fate decisions. I developed [scTOP](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.201873) ([Github repo](https://github.com/Emergent-Behaviors-in-Biology/scTOP/tree/main)), a Python package for tracking cell identity from single-cell RNA-sequencing data using Hopfield-inspired cell fate coordinates. Feel free to reach out if you'd like help applying it to your analysis! I'm also working on mathematical models of differentiation to identify general classes of cell fate decisions.
